# Image Optimizer

This script is designed to optimize `.jpg` images by compressing them. It takes images from the `in` folder, compresses them, and saves the optimized images in the `out` folder.

## How to Use

1. **Prepare the Input Folder**
   Place all the `.jpg` images you want to optimize in the `in` folder.

2. **Run the Script**
   Execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python3 main.py
```

3. **Retrieve Optimized Images**
   After the script completes, find your compressed images in the out folder.
